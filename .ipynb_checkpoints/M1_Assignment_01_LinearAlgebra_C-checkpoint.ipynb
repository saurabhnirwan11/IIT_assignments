        "Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics, but the truth of it is that linear algebra is the mathematics of data. Matrices and vectors are the language of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear algebra is about linear combinations. That is, using arithmetic on columns of numbers called vectors and arrays of numbers called matrices, to create new columns and arrays of numbers. Linear algebra is the study of lines and planes, vector spaces and mappings that are required for linear transforms.\n",

        "$A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\[0.3em] a_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\[0.3em] \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\[0.3em] a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn} \\end{bmatrix}$\n",

Also, the system is called linear if the variables are only to the first power, are only in the numerator and there are no products of variables in any of the equations.\n",

If you measure how trigger-pulling affects measurement device position, you could then “correct” your real measurements to “project out” the effect of the trigger pulling.
